Post-Base indices are used in field line representations for entries with absolute indices greater than or equal to Base, starting at 0 for the entry with absolute index equal to Base and increasing in the same direction as the absolute index.

反向索引被用于字段行指称中，指向绝对索引大于等于基点的条目。反向索引`0`指向的是绝对索引等于基点的条目。反向索引的上升方向与绝对索引一致。

Post-Base indices allow an encoder to process a field section in a single pass and include references to entries added while processing this (or other) field sections.

反向索引使得编码器能够单向地按顺序处理字段组（即“单通”），并使用指向在处理该（或其他）字段组时添加的条目的引用。
