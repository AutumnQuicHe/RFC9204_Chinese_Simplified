There is no currently known attack against a static Huffman encoding. A study has shown that using a static Huffman encoding table created an information leakage; however, this same study concluded that an attacker could not take advantage of this information leakage to recover any meaningful amount of information (see [PETAL]).

针对静态哈夫曼编码，目前没有已知的攻击手段。
研究表明，使用静态哈夫曼编码表会产生信息泄漏；然而，该研究的结论中也表示攻击者无法利用该信息来恢复出任何有意义的信息（详见《[PETAL]()》）。
