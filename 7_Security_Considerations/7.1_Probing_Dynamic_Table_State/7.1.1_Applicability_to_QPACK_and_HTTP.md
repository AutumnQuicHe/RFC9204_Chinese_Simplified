QPACK mitigates, but does not completely prevent, attacks modeled on CRIME ([CRIME]) by forcing a guess to match an entire field line rather than individual characters. An attacker can only learn whether a guess is correct or not, so the attacker is reduced to a brute-force guess for the field values associated with a given field name.

通过强制猜测必须与整个字段行，而不是单个字符，匹配的方法，QPACK能够抵御，但不能完全阻挡，基于CRIME（详见《[CRIME]()》）模型的攻击。
攻击者只能够学习到猜测的正确与否，于是攻击者被限制为只能对给定的字段名称暴力猜测其字段值。

Therefore, the viability of recovering specific field values depends on the entropy of values. As a result, values with high entropy are unlikely to be recovered successfully. However, values with low entropy remain vulnerable.

因此，破解特定字段值的可行性取决于值的熵。
从而，具有高熵的值不太可能被成功破解。
不过，具有底墒的值仍易受攻击。

Attacks of this nature are possible any time that two mutually distrustful entities control requests or responses that are placed onto a single HTTP/3 connection. If the shared QPACK compressor permits one entity to add entries to the dynamic table, and the other to refer to those entries while encoding chosen field lines, then the attacker (the second entity) can learn the state of the table by observing the length of the encoded output.

无论何时，只要两个互不信任实体的请求或响应被放置在同一条HTTP/3连接上，那么这类攻击就是可行的。
如果共享的QPACK压缩器允许某个实体向动态表添加条目，且允许另一个实体在编码所选的字段行时引用那些条目，那么攻击者（即“另一个实体”）就能够通过观测编码输出长度的方式学习到表的状态。

For example, requests or responses from mutually distrustful entities can occur when an intermediary either:

举例来说，请求和响应来自互不信任的实体的情况可能出现在某中间设备：

* sends requests from multiple clients on a single connection toward an origin server, or

* 在同一条连接上向某源服务器发送来自多个客户端的请求时，或

* takes responses from multiple origin servers and places them on a shared connection toward a client.

* 从多个源服务器获取响应，再将它们放到通向同一个客户端的共享连接上时。

Web browsers also need to assume that requests made on the same connection by different web origins ([RFC6454]) are made by mutually distrustful entities. Other scenarios involving mutually distrustful entities are also possible.

网络浏览器还应该假设在同一条连接上的不同网络源（详见《[RFC6454]()》）的请求是由互不信任的实体产生的。
还可能存在其他包含互不信任实体的场景。
