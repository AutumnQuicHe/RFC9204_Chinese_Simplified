After processing an encoded field section whose declared Required Insert Count is not zero, the decoder emits a Section Acknowledgment instruction. The instruction starts with the '1' 1-bit pattern, followed by the field section's associated stream ID encoded as a 7-bit prefix integer; see Section 4.1.1.

在处理完一个插入计数下限非零的编码字段组后，解码器会发射一个“组确认（Section Acknowledgment）”指令。
该指令以`1`这1个比特位起始，后面跟着与该字段组关联的流ID，以7位前缀整型编码；详见[第4.1.1章]()。

This instruction is used as described in Sections 2.1.4 and 2.2.2.

[第2.1.4章]()和[第2.2.2章]()中介绍了该指令的用法。

TODO: Figure 9: Section Acknowledgment

If an encoder receives a Section Acknowledgment instruction referring to a stream on which every encoded field section with a non-zero Required Insert Count has already been acknowledged, this MUST be treated as a connection error of type QPACK_DECODER_STREAM_ERROR.

如果编码器接收到的组确认指令所指向的流上所有插入计数下限非零的字段组均已得到确认，那么它**必须**将这种情况视作类型为`QPACK_DECODER_STREAM_ERROR`（解码流错误）的连接错误。

The Section Acknowledgment instruction might increase the Known Received Count; see Section 2.1.4.

组确认指令可能造成已知接收计数上升；详见[第2.1.4章]()。
