After processing an encoded field section whose declared Required Insert Count is not zero, the decoder emits a Section Acknowledgment instruction. The instruction starts with the '1' 1-bit pattern, followed by the field section's associated stream ID encoded as a 7-bit prefix integer; see Section 4.1.1.

This instruction is used as described in Sections 2.1.4 and 2.2.2.

TODO: Figure 9: Section Acknowledgment

If an encoder receives a Section Acknowledgment instruction referring to a stream on which every encoded field section with a non-zero Required Insert Count has already been acknowledged, this MUST be treated as a connection error of type QPACK_DECODER_STREAM_ERROR.

The Section Acknowledgment instruction might increase the Known Received Count; see Section 2.1.4.
