When a stream is reset or reading is abandoned, the decoder emits a Stream Cancellation instruction. The instruction starts with the '01' 2-bit pattern, followed by the stream ID of the affected stream encoded as a 6-bit prefix integer.

当一条流被重置或被放弃时，解码器会发射一个“流取消（Stream Cancellation）”指令。该指令以`01`这2个比特位起始，后面跟着这个流以6位前缀整型编码的流ID。

This instruction is used as described in Section 2.2.2.

[第2.2.2章]()中介绍了该指令的用法。
